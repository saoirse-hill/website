                      my ever-present brain fog makes it exceptionally difficult
                      to track my life plan and todos for my day/week/month.
                      right now i lean on my haphazardly crafted "system" that
                      exists entirely in a veritable labyrinth of notes on my
                      phone. i've tried a few different apps but theyre all
                      square pegs trying to get in a round hole so i figured i'd
                      make my own. the general idea is that its a tag-based
                      daily planner that does all the work for you. you can add
                      items, each item has a set of tags you apply, then you can
                      make dashboards by filtering, grouping, and sorting these
                      items by their tags. with a calendar integration, it will
                      help "fuzzy plan" your day by looking at your set
                      appointments and seeing what you have time for. this is
                      ideal for me because having a down to the minute
                      intenerary isn't condusive to my productivity. ill just
                      get overwhelmed and do nothing. please lmk if this sounds
                      valuable to you. i'm building this with next and node
                      because its my bread and butter, for job security purposes
                      and because i intend to use it as a progressive web app on
                      my phone (at least at first, i dont want to deal with
                      mobile app dev for a prototype)

                    needs one, reach out to me and if youre team doesnt need

                    was about 6 people and i worked with around 10 on a weekly

                    i worked at amazon which is one of the largest corpations on

                      stacks and workflows without much (if any) documentation.

                      tech stack was almost entirely javascript and typescript.
                      the bulk of the engineering work involved a postgresql
                      server, 2 node servers, 2 react apps, a react native
                      mobile app, and a couple of microservices (typically
                      involving aws lambda). we used aws daily, especially
                      lambda. i was offically part time until i graduated
                      college but nevertheless i made significant contributions
                      during that time

                      orignally started as an aerospace engineering major but
                      became disenchanted with the idea of calculating stress
                      forces on wings and making missiles. plus i had a lot of
                      fun messing with python so i switched to computer science.
                      that being said, rocket science and space are both rad as
                      heck and i've explored working at blue origin and spacex
