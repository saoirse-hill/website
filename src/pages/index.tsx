                    non-technical. I dream of working on cross-functional teams,

                    information, collaborating on features and advocating for

                    was about 6 people and i worked with around 10 on a weekly
                    basis. overall, the whole company was around 30 people. then
                    i worked at amazon which is one of the largest corpations on
                    the planet. i think something on the smaller size is right
                    for me but i care more about the mission than anything else.
                    i'd love to work niche tech, healthcare, or something

                      i wasnt here for very long but i still managed to get a
                      lot done. pretty much exclusively worked with java and
                      spring making/extending/maintaing applications (full stack
                      role). day to day work was focused on small, metric driven
                      tasks. got a lot of experience figuring out complex tech
                      stacks and workflows without much (if any) documentation.

                      tiny seed stage startup. very tight knit engineering team
                      that worked with other departments closely, especially the
                      design team and the customer support team. huge emphasis
                      on project/feature ownership. typical feature lifecycle
                      breakdown: design, implement and code review as
                      individuals or pairs. design review and test as a team.
                      tech stack was almost entirely javascript and typescript.
                      the bulk of the engineering work involved a postgresql
                      server, 2 node servers, 2 react apps, a react native
                      mobile app, and a couple of microservices (typically
                      involving aws lambda). we used aws daily, especially
                      lambda. i was offically part time until i graduated

                      orignally started as an aerospace engineering major but
                      became disenchanted with the idea of calculating stress
                      forces on wings and making missiles. plus i had a lot of
                      fun messing with python so i switched to computer science.
